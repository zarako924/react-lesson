To embed a js expr inside of jsx, use curlies:
<h1>{2+2}</h1>

To pass props to a react component
<Foo x={10} y={10}/>

To access props from within a react component:
function Foo(props) {
    return <div>Foo {props.x + props.y}</div>
}

Conditional render: if or ternary
Repeat render: array.map()

In Javascript, it is common to pass args of type: function


function f1 (x,y,z) {}
var o = "1"
f1(o,o,o)

function f2 ({x,y,z}) {}
var o = {"x":"1","y":"2","z":"3"}
f2(o)

Two types of React Components:
    function
    class

why would you ever create a component as a class?
    state:
        in a class component when you update state, it refreshes automatically
        advanced features: override lifecycle callbacks

class components can have state vars and/or props vars
    props are passed in from above (like html attributes) - they are read only
    state is read/write and can be modified by the component that owns the state
    one component's props are another component's state


function f1() {
    var x = 3
    var s = `I have ${x} kids`
}
